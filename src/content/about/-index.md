Hey this is the best thing about new technology, you can cadd changes anywhere and figure it out on the fly.
 I kinda wonder why this works sometimes and other times it really doesn't.  
ðŸ¥¸ I have found that using markdown files is much easier to edit as I'm driving content specifically to the site.  It's really interesting how quickly technology allows for some very unique changes.
I've been coding for 7 years and I'm always amazed with how fast things change.
